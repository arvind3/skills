Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article Note This document refers to the Microsoft Foundry (classic) portal. 🔄 Switch to the Microsoft Foundry (new) documentation if you're using the new portal. Note This document refers to the Microsoft Foundry (new) portal. Most businesses don't want just chatbots. They want automation that's faster and has fewer errors. That desire might mean summarizing documents, processing invoices, managing support tickets, or publishing blog posts. In all cases, the goal is the same: freeing people and resources to focus on higher-value work by offloading repetitive and predictable tasks. Large language models (LLMs) introduce a new type of automation with systems that can understand unstructured data, make decisions, and generate content. In practice, businesses can have difficulty moving beyond demos and into production. LLMs can drift, be incorrect, and lack accountability. Without visibility, policy enforcement, and orchestration, these models are hard to trust in real business workflows. Microsoft Foundry is designed to change that. It's a platform that combines models, tools, frameworks, and governance into a unified system for building intelligent agents. At the center of this system is Foundry Agent Service , which enables the operation of agents across development, deployment, and production. Agent Service connects the core pieces of Foundry, such as models, tools, and frameworks, into a single runtime. It manages conversations, orchestrates tool calls, enforces content safety, and integrates with identity, networking, and observability systems. Thes

Foundry IQ frequently asked questions Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article Find answers to common questions about Foundry IQ . General What is Foundry IQ? Foundry IQ enables agents to access, process, and act on knowledge from anywhere. With Foundry IQ, you create a knowledge base that connects to one or more knowledge sources . The agentic retrieval engine processes queries, and an optional large language model (LLM) from Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models adds query planning and reasoning. Agents built in Foundry Agent Service call the knowledge base to retrieve relevant content. What is the difference between Foundry IQ and agentic retrieval? Foundry IQ consists of knowledge bases, knowledge sources, and native integrations with Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models and Foundry Agent Service. The Microsoft Foundry (new) portal offers a streamlined, end-to-end setup experience, but you can also create the Foundry IQ components programmatically. Agentic retrieval is the multi-query retrieval engine that powers Foundry IQ knowledge bases. For custom solutions, you can use agentic retrieval directly via the Azure AI Search APIs. How is Foundry IQ different from existing RAG patterns or Azure OpenAI On Your Data? One Foundry IQ knowledge base provides access to multiple sources, removing the need to connect each agent to each source individually. The agentic retrieval engine plans which sources to query and performs iterative search if initial results don't meet relevance standards. Indexing and data synchronization are triggered automatically. Iterative search depends on specifying a medium retrieval reasoning effort in th

Agent runtime components Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article Agent runtime components are the core objects—agents, conversations, and responses—that power stateful, multi-turn interactions in Microsoft Foundry Agent Service. Together, these components let you generate outputs, persist state across turns, and build conversational applications. This article explains the roles of an agent , conversation , and response , and how they work together during response generation. Prerequisites A Microsoft Foundry project . Familiarity with the agent development lifecycle (optional). How runtime components work together When you work with an agent, you follow a consistent pattern: Create an agent : Define an agent to start sending messages and receiving responses. Create a conversation (optional) : Use a conversation to maintain history across turns. If you don't use a conversation, carry forward context by using the output from a previous response. Generate a response : The agent processes input items in the conversation and any instructions provided in the request. The agent might append items to the conversation. Check response status : Monitor the response until it finishes (especially in streaming or background mode). Retrieve the response : Display the generated response to the user. The following diagram illustrates how these components interact in a typical agent loop. You provide user input (and optionally conversation history), the service generates a response (including tool calls when configured), and the resulting items can be reused as context for the next turn.

Agent identity concepts in Microsoft Foundry Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article An agent identity is a specialized identity type in Microsoft Entra ID that's designed specifically for AI agents. It provides a standardized framework for governing, authenticating, and authorizing AI agents across Microsoft services. This framework enables agents to securely access resources, interact with users, and communicate with other systems. Microsoft Foundry automatically provisions and manages agent identities throughout the agent lifecycle. This integration simplifies permission management while maintaining security and auditability as agents move from development to production. This article explains how agent identities relate to Microsoft Entra ID objects, how Foundry uses them when an agent calls tools, and how to apply least-privilege access with Azure role-based access control (RBAC). Prerequisites Understanding of Microsoft Entra ID and OAuth authentication Familiarity with Azure role-based access control (RBAC) Basic knowledge of AI agents and their runtime requirements For Foundry-specific RBAC roles and scopes, see Azure role-based access control in Foundry . How agent identities work in Foundry Foundry uses Microsoft Entra ID agent identities to support two related needs: Management and governance : Give administrators a consistent way to inventory agents, apply policies, and audit activity. Tool authentication : Let an agent authenticate to downstream systems (for example, Azure Storage) without embedding secrets in prompts, code, or connection strings. At a high level, Foundry does the following: Provisions

System message design Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article System messages help you steer an Azure OpenAI chat model toward the behavior, tone, and output format you want. This article explains what system messages are, how they affect responses, and how to design them for consistency and safety. What this article covers This article focuses on the system message (sometimes called a system prompt or metaprompt ) for chat-based experiences. If you want broader prompt guidance (few-shot examples, ordering, and token efficiency), see Prompt engineering techniques . Prerequisites To use system messages, you need access to an Azure OpenAI resource with a chat completion model deployment. For setup instructions, see Create and deploy an Azure OpenAI resource . What is a system message? A system message is a set of instructions and context you provide to the model to guide its responses. You typically use it to: Define the assistant’s role and boundaries. Set tone and communication style. Specify output formats (for example, JSON). Add safety and quality constraints for your scenario. A system message can be one short sentence: You are a helpful AI assistant. Or it can be multiple lines with structured rules and formatting requirements. Important A system message influences the model, but it doesn’t guarantee compliance. You still need to test and iterate, and you should layer system messages with other mitigations (for example, filtering and evaluation). How system messages work In chat-based APIs, you send a set of messages that include roles such as system , user , and assistant . The system message typically appea

Safety system messages Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article Safety system messages help you guide an Azure OpenAI model’s behavior, improve response quality, and reduce the likelihood of harmful outputs. They work best as one layer in a broader safety strategy. Note This article uses "system message" interchangeably with "metaprompt" and "system prompt." Here, we use "system message" to align with common terminology. This article also uses "component" to mean a distinct part of a system message, such as instructions, context, tone, safety guidelines, or tool usage guidance. What is a system message? A system message is a set of high-priority instructions and context that you send to a chat model to steer how it responds. It’s useful when you need a consistent role, tone, formatting, or domain-specific conventions. What is a safety system message? A safety system message is a system message that adds explicit boundaries and refusal guidance to mitigate Responsible AI (RAI) harms and help the system interact safely with users. Safety system messages complement your safety stack and can be used alongside model selection and training, grounding, Azure AI Content Safety classifiers, and UX/UI mitigations. Learn more about Responsible AI practices for Azure OpenAI models . Key components of a system message Most system messages combine multiple components: Role and task : What the assistant is and what it’s responsible for. Audience and tone : Who the response is for, and the expected voice. Scope and boundaries : What the assistant must not do, and what to do when it can’t comply. Safety guidelines : Rules that redu

For more information, see Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews . Microsoft Foundry provides an observability platform for monitoring and tracing AI agents. It captures key details during an agent run, such as inputs, outputs, tool usage, retries, latencies, and costs. Understanding the reasoning behind your agent's executions is important for troubleshooting and debugging. However, understanding complex agents presents challenges for several reasons: There could be a high number of steps involved in generating a response, making it hard to keep track of all of them. The sequence of steps might vary based on user input. The inputs/outputs at each stage might be long and deserve more detailed inspection. Each step of an agent's runtime might also involve nesting. For example, an agent might invoke a tool, which uses another process, which then invokes another tool. If you notice strange or incorrect output from a top-level agent run, it might be difficult to determine exactly where in the execution the issue was introduced. Trace results solve this by allowing you to view the inputs and outputs of each primitive involved in a particular agent run, displayed in the order they were invoked, making it easy to understand and debug your AI agent's behavior.

Tool best practices for Microsoft Foundry Agent Service Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article When you build agents in Microsoft Foundry Agent Service, tools extend what your agent can do—retrieving information, calling APIs, and connecting to external services. This article helps you configure tools effectively, control when the model calls them, and keep your data secure. Tip In your agent instructions, describe what each tool is for and when to use it. For example: When you need information from my indexed documents, use File Search. When you need to call an API, use the OpenAPI tool. When a tool call fails or returns no results, explain what happened and ask a follow-up question. Prerequisites Access to a Foundry project in the Foundry portal with the Azure AI Developer role or equivalent permissions. A model deployed in the same project. Any required connections configured for the tools you plan to use (for example, Azure AI Search, SharePoint, or Bing grounding). Configure and validate tool usage Configure tools and connections in the Foundry tool catalog. See Discover and manage tools in the Foundry tool catalog (preview) . Review run traces to confirm when your agent calls tools and to inspect tool inputs and outputs. For end-to-end tracing setup, see Trace your application .

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and indexes Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a pattern that combines search with large language models (LLMs) so responses are grounded in your data. This article explains how RAG works in Microsoft Foundry, what role indexes play, and how agentic retrieval changes classic RAG patterns. LLMs are trained on public data available at training time. If you need answers based on your private data, or on frequently changing information, RAG helps you: Retrieve relevant information from your data (often through an index). Provide that information to the model as grounding data. Generate a response that can include citations back to source content. What is RAG? Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are trained on public internet data that was available when the model was trained. The public data might not be sufficient for your needs. For example, you might want answers based on private documents, or you might need up-to-date information. RAG addresses this by retrieving relevant content from your data and including it in the model input. The model can then generate responses grounded in the retrieved content. Key concepts for RAG: Grounding data : Retrieved content you provide to the model to reduce guessing. Index : A data structure optimized for retrieval (keyword, semantic, vector, or hybrid search). Embeddings : Numeric representations of content used for vector similarity search. See Understand embeddings . System message and prompts : Instructions that guide how the model uses retrieved content. See Prompt engineering and Safety

Agent2Agent (A2A) authentication Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article The Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol enables your agents to invoke other agents. Most A2A endpoints require authentication to access the endpoint and its underlying service. Configuring authentication ensures that only authorized users can invoke your A2A tools in Foundry Agent Service. This article explains the authentication methods available for A2A connections and helps you choose the right approach for your scenario. Authentication scenarios In general, there are two authentication scenarios: Shared authentication : Every user of your agent uses the same identity to authenticate to the A2A endpoint. Individual user context doesn't persist. This approach is ideal when all users should have the same level of access. For example, if you build a chat agent to retrieve information from Azure Cosmos DB for your organization, you might want every user to access the same shared container without requiring individual sign-in. Individual authentication : Each user of your agent authenticates with their own account, so their user context persists across interactions. This approach is essential when actions should be scoped to the user's permissions. For example, if you build a coding agent that retrieves commits and pull requests from GitHub, you want each developer to sign in with their own GitHub account so they only see repositories they have access to. Prerequisites Before you choose an authentication method, you need: Access to the Foundry portal and a project. If you don't have one, see Create projects in Foundry .

Model versions in Microsoft Foundry Models Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article Microsoft Foundry Models are committed to providing the best generative AI models for customers. As part of this commitment, Foundry Models regularly releases new model versions to incorporate the latest features and improvements from key model providers in the industry. How model versions work We want to make it easy for customers to stay up to date as models improve. Customers can choose to start with a particular version and stay on it or to automatically update as new versions are released. We distinguish two different versions when working with models: The version of the model itself. The version of the API used to consume a model deployment. The version of a model is decided when you deploy it. You can choose an update policy, which can include the following options: Deployments set with a specific version or without offering an upgrade policy require a manual upgrade if a new version is released. When the model is retired, those deployments stop working. Deployments set to Auto-update to default automatically update to use the new default version. Deployments set to Upgrade when expired automatically update when its current version is retired. Note Update policies are configured per deployment and vary by model and provider. The API version indicates the contract that you use to interface with the model in code. When using REST APIs, you indicate the API version using the query parameter api-version . Azure SDKs versions are usually paired with specific APIs versions but you can indicate the API version you want to use. A giv

GPT-5 vs GPT-4.1: choosing the right model for your use case Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article GPT-5 is the first model from OpenAI that introduces four adjustable levels of thinking, controlling the amount of time and tokens the model uses when responding to a prompt. When selecting which model to use, or whether to use a reasoning model at all, it is important to consider your application’s priorities. Scenarios like researching and producing a report involve the collection, processing, and generation of large amounts of data. Customers in these scenarios are typically willing to wait many minutes for a high-quality report to be generated. A reasoning model like GPT-5 with medium or high thinking is great for this use case. Another example is a coding assistant, where you want to vary the amount of thinking based on the complexity of the coding task. Here, you want your customers to have control over the amount of time and level of effort the model exerts before providing a response. GPT-5 or GPT-5 mini with controllable thinking levels are a great solution. In contrast, a customer service assistant that is answering customer questions live, retrieving information from a highly efficient search index, and providing human-like responses needs to be fast, friendly, and efficient. For these scenarios, OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 is a far better option. Choosing the right model for your use case can be a challenging endeavor, so we’ve created this simple guide to help you pick between the two latest flagship models from OpenAI – GPT-5 and GPT-4.1.

Guardrails and controls overview in Microsoft Foundry Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article Microsoft Foundry offers safety and security guardrails that can be applied to core models, including image generation models, and agents. Agent guardrails are in preview. Guardrails consist of a set of controls. The controls define a risk to be detected, intervention points to scan for the risk, and the response action to take in the model or agent when the risk is detected. For example, a risk detection could be the annotation of the risk or blocking the model or agent from further output. Risks are flagged via a set of classification models designed to detect and prevent the output of undesirable behavior and/or harmful content. Four intervention points are currently supported: user input, tool call (Preview), tool response (Preview), and output. Tool call and tool responses intervention points are applicable to agents only and scan the tool call made as well as content sent to the tool, and the output back from the tool, respectively. Variations in API configurations and application design might affect completions and thus filtering behavior. Important The guardrail system applies to all Models sold directly by Azure, except for prompts and completions processed by the audio models such as Whisper. For more information, see Audio models in Azure OpenAI . The guardrail system currently applies only to agents developed in the Foundry Agent Service, not to other agents registered in the Foundry Control Plane. Guardrails for agents vs models An individual Foundry guardrail can be applied to one or many models and one or m

Note This document refers to the Microsoft Foundry (new) portal. Azure OpenAI GPT Realtime API for speech and audio is part of the GPT-4o model family that supports low-latency, "speech in, speech out" conversational interactions. The GPT Realtime API is designed to handle real-time, low-latency conversational interactions. It's a great fit for use cases involving live interactions between a user and a model, such as customer support agents, voice assistants, and real-time translators. Most users of the Realtime API, including applications that use WebRTC or a telephony system, need to deliver and receive audio from an end-user in real time. The Realtime API isn't designed to connect directly to end user devices. It relies on client integrations to terminate end user audio streams. You can use the Realtime API via WebRTC, SIP, or WebSocket to send audio input to the model and receive audio responses in real time. In most cases, we recommend using the WebRTC API for low-latency real-time audio streaming.

Work with chat completions models Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article Chat models are language models that are optimized for conversational interfaces. The models behave differently than the older completion API models. Previous models were text-in and text-out, which means they accepted a prompt string and returned a completion to append to the prompt. However, the latest models are conversation-in and message-out. The models expect input formatted in a specific chat-like transcript format. They return a completion that represents a model-written message in the chat. This format was designed specifically for multi-turn conversations, but it can also work well for nonchat scenarios. This article walks you through getting started with chat completions models. To get the best results, use the techniques described here. Don't try to interact with the models the same way you did with the older model series because the models are often verbose and provide less useful responses. Work with chat completion models The following code snippet shows the most basic way to interact with models that use the Chat Completion API.

Process asynchronous groups of requests with separate quota, with 24-hour target turnaround, at 50% less cost than global standard . With batch processing, rather than send one request at a time you send a large number of requests in a single file. Global batch requests have a separate enqueued token quota avoiding any disruption of your online workloads. Key use cases include: Large-Scale Data Processing: Quickly analyze extensive datasets in parallel. Content Generation: Create large volumes of text, such as product descriptions or articles. Document Review and Summarization: Automate the review and summarization of lengthy documents. Customer Support Automation: Handle numerous queries simultaneously for faster responses. Data Extraction and Analysis: Extract and analyze information from vast amounts of unstructured data. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tasks: Perform tasks like sentiment analysis or translation on large datasets. Marketing and Personalization: Generate personalized content and recommendations at scale. Tip If your batch jobs are so large that you are hitting the enqueued token limit even after maxing out the quota for your deployment, certain regions now support a new feature that allows you to queue multiple batch jobs with exponential backoff. Once your enqueued token quota is available, the next batch job can be created and kicked off automatically. To learn more, see automating retries of lar

Prompt caching Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article Prompt caching allows you to reduce overall request latency and cost for longer prompts that have identical content at the beginning of the prompt. "Prompt" in this context is referring to the input you send to the model as part of your chat completions request. Rather than reprocess the same input tokens over and over again, the service is able to retain a temporary cache of processed input token computations to improve overall performance. Prompt caching has no impact on the output content returned in the model response beyond a reduction in latency and cost. For supported models, cached tokens are billed at a discount on input token pricing for Standard deployment types and up to 100% discount on input tokens for Provisioned deployment types. Azure AI Foundry Model prompt caches are cleared within 24 hours. Prompt caches aren't shared between Azure subscriptions. Supported models Prompt caching is supported with all Azure OpenAI models GPT-4o or newer. Prompt caching applies to models that have chat-completion, completion, responses, or real-time operations.

Note This document refers to the Microsoft Foundry (new) portal. Prompt transformation is a process included in the DALL-E 3 models that applies a safety and quality system message to your original prompt. It uses a large language model (LLM) to add a message before sending your prompt to the image generation model. This system message enriches your original prompt with the goal of generating more diverse and higher-quality images while maintaining intent. After prompt transformation is applied to the original prompt, content filtering is applied as a secondary step before image generation. For more information, see Content filtering . Tip Learn more about image generation prompting in OpenAI's Image generation documentation . Prompt transformation example Example text prompt Example generated image without prompt transformation Example generated image with prompt transformation "Watercolor painting of the Seattle skyline" Why is prompt transformation needed? Prompt transformation is essential for responsible and high-quality generations. Not only does prompt transformation improve the safety of your generated image, but it also enriches your prompt in a more descriptive manner, leading to higher quality and descriptive imagery. Default prompt transformation contains safety enhancements that steer the model away from generating images of Copyright Studio characters and artwork, public figures, and oth

Table of contents Exit editor mode Ask Learn Ask Learn Focus mode Table of contents Read in English Add Add to plan Edit Share via Facebook x.com LinkedIn Email Print Note Access to this page requires authorization. You can try signing in or changing directories . Access to this page requires authorization. You can try changing directories . Microsoft Foundry fine-tuning considerations Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pretrained language model and adapting it to perform a specific task or improve its performance on a particular dataset. This involves training the model on a smaller, task-specific dataset while adjusting the model's weights slightly. Fine-tuning leverages the knowledge the model acquired during its initial training on a large, diverse dataset, allowing it to specialize without starting from scratch. This approach is often more efficient than training a new model from scratch; for example, many teams fine-tune with hundreds to thousands of labeled examples instead of retraining on millions of samples. Key benefits of fine-tuning Enhanced accuracy and relevance Fine-tuning improves the model's performance on particular tasks by training it with task-specific data. This often results in more accurate and relevant high-quality outputs compared to using general prompts. Unlike few-shot learning, where only a limited number of examples can be included in a prompt, fine-tuning allows you to train the model on an additional dataset. Fine-tuning helps the model learn more nuanced patterns and improves task performance. Efficiency and potential cost savings Fine-tuned models require shorter prompts because they are trained on relevant examples. This process reduces the number of tokens needed in each request, which can lead to cost savings depending on the use case. Since fine-tuned models need fewer examples in the prompt, they process requests faster, resulting in quicker response times. Scalabilit

Customize a model with fine-tuning Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article Learn how to fine-tune models in Microsoft Foundry for your datasets and use cases. Fine-tuning enables: Higher-quality results than what you can get just from prompt engineering . The ability to train on more examples than what can fit into a model's request context limit. Token savings due to shorter prompts. Lower-latency requests, particularly when you're using smaller models. In contrast to few-shot learning, fine-tuning improves the model by training on more examples than what fits in a prompt. Because weights adapt to your task, you include fewer examples or instructions. Including less reduces tokens per call and potentially lowers cost and latency. We use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune models in a way that reduces their complexity without significantly affecting their performance. This method works by approximating the original high-rank matrix with a lower-rank one. Fine-tuning a smaller subset of important parameters during the supervised training phase makes the model more manageable and efficient. For users, it also makes training faster and more affordable than other techniques. In this article, you learn how to: Choose appropriate datasets and formats for fine-tuning. Trigger a fine-tuning job, monitor the status, and fetch results. Deploy and evaluate a fine-tuned model. Iterate based on evaluation feedback.

Direct preference optimization (preview) Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article Direct preference optimization (DPO) is an alignment technique for large language models, used to adjust model weights based on human preferences. It differs from reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in that it does not require fitting a reward model and uses simpler binary data preferences for training. It is computationally lighter weight and faster than RLHF, while being equally effective at alignment. Why is DPO useful? DPO is especially useful in scenarios where there's no clear-cut correct answer, and subjective elements like tone, style, or specific content preferences are important. This approach also enables the model to learn from both positive examples (what's considered correct or ideal) and negative examples (what's less desired or incorrect). DPO is believed to be a technique that will make it easier for customers to generate high-quality training data sets. While many customers struggle to generate sufficient large data sets for supervised fine-tuning, they often have preference data already collected based on user logs, A/B tests, or smaller manual annotation efforts. Direct preference optimization dataset format Direct preference optimization files have a different format than supervised fine-tuning. Customers provide a "conversation" containing the system message and the initial user message, and then "completions" with paired preference data. Users can only provide two completions. Three top-level fields: input , preferred_output and non_preferred_output Each element in the preferred_output/non_preferre

Reinforcement fine-tuning Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a technique for improving reasoning models by training them through a reward-based process, rather than relying only on labeled data. RFT helps models develop better reasoning and problem-solving skills, especially in cases where labeled examples are limited or complex behaviors are desired. Note The fine-tuning service automatically pauses RFT jobs once they hit $5,000 in total training costs (training + grading). Users can deploy the most recent checkpoint or resume the training job. If the user decides to resume the job, billing continues for the job with no further cost-based limits. Model support Reinforcement fine-tuning is supported for the following models: o4-mini version 2025-04-16 gpt-5 version 2025-08-07 (preview) GPT-5 support for reinforcement fine tuning is in private preview and might not be available in your subscription. Requirements Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) requires training and validation data formatted as JSONL and containing a messages array using the chat completions format. However, RFT has more requirements: Data The final "message" in the data must be assigned a user role. The data can contain extra fields and values for use by a grader. Both a training and a validation dataset must be provided. Graders A grader must be defined to score the quality of your fine-tuned model and guide learning. Only a single grader can be provided, but multiple graders can be combined using a multigrader. Example training data The following example shows how to present prompts to the model and include

Fine-tuning and tool calling Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article Models that use the chat completions API support tool calling . Unfortunately, functions defined in your chat completion calls don't always perform as expected. Fine-tuning your model with tool calling examples can improve model output by enabling you to: Get similarly formatted responses even when the full function definition isn't present. (Allowing you to potentially save money on prompt tokens.) Get more accurate and consistent outputs. Note function_call and functions have been deprecated in favor of tools . It is recommended to use the tools parameter instead. Tool calling (recommended) Constructing a training file When constructing a training file of tool calling examples, you would take a function definition like this: { "messages": [ { "role": "user", "content": "What is the weather in San Francisco?" }, { "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [ { "id": "call_id", "type": "function", "function": { "name": "get_current_weather", "arguments": "{\"location\": \"San Francisco, USA\", \"format\": \"celsius\"}" } } ] } ], "tools": [ { "type": "function", "function": { "name": "get_current_weather", "description": "Get the current weather", "parameters": { "type": "object", "properties": { "location": { "type": "string", "description": "The city and country/region, eg.

Learn more about risks, capabilities, and limitations in the Overview of Responsible AI practices and Transparency Note . To help mitigate the risks associated with advanced fine-tuned models, we have implemented additional evaluation steps to help detect and prevent harmful content in the training and outputs of fine-tuned models. These steps are grounded in the Microsoft Responsible AI Standard and Azure Microsoft Foundry Models content filtering . Evaluations are conducted in dedicated, customer specific, private workspaces; Evaluation endpoints are in the same geography as the Foundry resource; Training data isn't stored in connection with performing evaluations; only the final model assessment (deployable or not deployable) is persisted; and Fine-tuned model evaluation filters are set to predefined thresholds and can't be modified by customers; they aren't tied to any custom content filtering configuration you might have created. Data evaluation Before training starts, your data is evaluated for potentially harmful content (violence, sexual, hate, and fairness, self-harm – see category definitions here ). If harmful content is detected above the specified severity level, your training job will fail, and you'll receive a message informing you of the categories of failure.

Cost management for fine-tuning Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article Fine-tuning can be intimidating: unlike base models, where you're just paying for input and output tokens for inferencing, fine-tuning requires training your custom models and dealing with hosting. This guide is intended to help you better understand the costs associated with fine-tuning and how to manage them. Important The numbers in this article are for example purposes only. You should always refer to the official pricing page for pricing details to use in the formulas provided in this article. Upfront investment - training your model This is the one-time, fixed cost associated with teaching a base model your specific requirements using your training data. Below, we explain how training costs can be calculated. For all training jobs, you have the option to use global standard (10-30% discount from regional standard training) or developer (50% discount from global). Neither Global nor Developer training guarantee data residency; developer training will run on pre-emptible spot capacity so may take longer to complete. Developer tier jobs may be paused by the system but will automatically resume; users do not incur charges for jobs in paused states. The calculation formula Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) & Preference Fine-Tuning (DPO) It's straightforward to estimate the costs for SFT & DPO. You're charged based on the number of tokens in your training file, and the number of epochs for your training job. $$ \text{price} = \text{# training tokens} \times \text{# epochs} \times \text{training price per token} $$ In general, smaller models and mor

For more information, see Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews . Microsoft Foundry provides an observability platform for monitoring and tracing AI agents. It captures key details during an agent run, such as inputs, outputs, tool usage, retries, latencies, and costs. Understanding the reasoning behind your agent's executions is important for troubleshooting and debugging. However, understanding complex agents presents challenges for several reasons: There could be a high number of steps involved in generating a response, making it hard to keep track of all of them. The sequence of steps might vary based on user input. The inputs/outputs at each stage might be long and deserve more detailed inspection. Each step of an agent's runtime might also involve nesting. For example, an agent might invoke a tool, which uses another process, which then invokes another tool. If you notice strange or incorrect output from a top-level agent run, it might be difficult to determine exactly where in the execution the issue was introduced. Trace results solve this by allowing you to view the inputs and outputs of each primitive involved in a particular agent run, displayed in the order they were invoked, making it easy to understand and debug your AI agent's behavior.

Azure AI Projects REST API reference Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article The Azure AI Projects REST API lets you work with AI projects , the central resource that brings together models, data, tools, and telemetry in Azure AI Foundry. Using familiar HTTP verbs you can create a project, configure secure connections to other Azure services, and retrieve ready-to-use endpoints for inferencing, agents, evaluation, and more. Because every service you attach lives behind a single project connection string, applications only need to know one credential and one base URL to reach everything they need. Authentication The Azure AI Projects REST API supports Microsoft Entra ID tokens for authentication. Azure resource keys are not yet supported. Access is controlled by Azure role-based access control (RBAC). For more details, see What is Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)? and Role-based access control for Azure AI Foundry . Versioning Azure AI Projects REST API provides two types of versioning: Evolving Version : These versions follow the format v# (e.g., v1, v2, v3). As the name suggests, evolving versions incorporate non-breaking changes to the contract, such as the addition of optional parameters to requests or new properties to responses. Clients using these versions should be designed to handle additive changes. Pinned Version : These are date-based versions that do not include contract changes. The following table illustrates how these versions work. Timeline Evolving Version Pinned Version Notes 25-May v1 5/1/2025 Customers who do not want any changes to the contract can use the date-based version. Custo

Azure OpenAI in Microsoft Foundry Models API lifecycle Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article This article is to help you understand the support lifecycle for Azure OpenAI APIs. Note New API response objects may be added to the API response at any time. We recommend you only parse the response objects you require. API evolution Previously, Azure OpenAI received monthly updates of new API versions. Taking advantage of new features required constantly updating code and environment variables with each new API release. Azure OpenAI also required the extra step of using Azure specific clients which created overhead when migrating code between OpenAI and Azure OpenAI. Starting in August 2025, you can now opt in to our next generation v1 Azure OpenAI APIs which add support for: Ongoing access to the latest features with no need to specify new api-version 's each month. Faster API release cycle with new features launching more frequently. OpenAI client support with minimal code changes to swap between OpenAI and Azure OpenAI when using key-based authentication. OpenAI client support for token based authentication and automatic token refresh without the need to take a dependency on a separate Azure OpenAI client. Make chat completions calls with models from other providers like DeepSeek and Grok which support the v1 chat completions syntax. Access to new API calls that are still in preview will be controlled by passing feature specific preview headers allowing you to opt in to the features you want, without having to swap API versions. Alternatively, some features will indicate preview status through their API path and do

Harm categories and severity levels in Microsoft Foundry Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article The content safety system integrated in Microsoft Foundry contains neural multiclass classification models aimed at detecting and filtering harmful content. The models cover four categories (hate, sexual, violence, and self-harm) across four severity levels (safe, low, medium, and high). Content detected at the 'safe' severity level is labeled in annotations but isn't subject to filtering and isn't configurable. The system also includes other optional classification models aimed at detecting jailbreak risk and known content for text and code. These models are binary classifiers that flag whether user or model behavior qualifies as a jailbreak attack or match to known text or source code. The use of these models is optional, but use of protected material code model may be required for Customer Copyright Commitment coverage. Note The text content safety models for the hate, sexual, violence, and self-harm categories are specifically trained and tested on the following languages: English, German, Japanese, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Chinese.

Prompt shields analyzes LLM inputs and detects adversarial user input attacks. Types of input attacks The types of input attacks that Prompt Shields detects are described in this table. Type Attacker Entry point Method Objective/impact Resulting behavior User Prompt attacks User User prompts Ignoring system prompts/RLHF training Altering intended LLM behavior Performing restricted actions against training Document attacks Third party Third-party content (documents, emails) Misinterpreting third-party content Gaining unauthorized access or control Executing unintended commands or actions Prompt Shields for user prompts Previously called Jailbreak risk detection , this shield targets User Prompt injection attacks, where users deliberately exploit system vulnerabilities to elicit unauthorized behavior from the LLM. This could lead to inappropriate content generation or violations of system-imposed restrictions. Examples Classification Description Example No prompt attack Requests from users aligned with the system’s intended use, without attempting to circumvent system rules.

PII detection is used to help prevent PII from being exposed or shared, protecting users from identity theft, financial fraud, or other types of privacy violations. In the context of large language models (LLMs), PII detection involves analyzing text content in LLM completions. When PII has been identified, it can be flagged for further review, or the output can be blocked. The PII filter scans the output of LLMs to identify and flag known personal information. It's designed to help organizations prevent the generation of content that closely matches sensitive personal information. PII types There are many different types of PII, and you can specify which types you want to filter. The set of PII types that can be detected by the filter matches the set that's defined in the Azure Language in Foundry Tools docs . Filtering modes The PII filter can be configured to operate in two modes. Annotate mode flags PII that's returned in the model output. Annotate and Block mode blocks the entire output if PII is detected. The filtering mode can be set for each PII category individually. Feedback Was this page helpful?

Ungroundedness refers to instances where the LLMs produce information that is non-factual or inaccurate from what was present in the source materials. Groundedness detection requires document embedding and formatting . Key terms Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) : RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with other data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data that was available at the time they were trained. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model’s cutoff date, you need to provide the model with that specific information. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). For more information, see Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) . Groundedness and Ungroundedness in LLMs : This refers to the extent to which the model's outputs are based on provided information or reflect reliable sources accurately. A grounded response adheres closely to the given information, avoiding speculation or fabrication. In groundedness measurements, source information is crucial and serves as the grounding source. User scenarios Groundedness detection supports text-based Summarization and QnA tasks to ensure that the generated summaries or answ

Intervention points Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article Agentic AI expands both capability and attack surface. As soon as an agent can call external tools, write to databases, or trigger downstream processes, malfunctions or malicious attacks can lead to steering it off course, leaking sensitive data, or executing harmful actions. Relying solely on guardrails applied to models can leave these vectors exposed. To close this gap Microsoft Foundry allows guardrails to be applied directly to agents and allows the individual controls within those guardrails to be applied to four different intervention points: Intervention Point Description Example Control at this Intervention Point User input A query sent from a user to a model or agent. Sometimes referred to as "prompt." Some controls at this intervention point require the inclusion of document embedding by the user to take effect. Risk: User input attacks Action: Annotate and block When this control is specified in an agent's or model's guardrail, the user's input is scanned by a classification model that detects jailbreak attacks. If an attack is detected, the user's input is blocked from being sent to the model, halting the model. Tool call (Preview) The next action the agent is proposing to take, as generated by its underlying model. The tool call consists of which tool is called and the arguments it's called with, including data being sent to the tool. Risk: Hate (High) Action: Annotate and block When this control is specified, every time the agent is about to execute a tool call, the proposed content being sent to the tool is scanned for hateful content.

Components of abuse monitoring There are several components to abuse monitoring: Content Classification : Classifier models detect harmful text and/or images in user prompts (inputs) and completions (outputs). The system looks for categories of harms as defined in the Content Requirements , and assigns severity levels as described in more detail on the Content Filtering page. The content classification signals contribute to pattern detection as described below. Abuse Pattern Capture : The abuse monitoring system for Azure Direct Models looks at customer usage patterns and employs algorithms and heuristics to detect and score indicators of potential abuse. Detected patterns consider, for example, the frequency and severity at which harmful content is detected (as indicated in content classifier signals) in a customer’s prompts and completions, as well as the intentionality of the behavior. The trends and urgency of the detected pattern will also affect scoring of potential abuse severity. For example, a higher volume of harmful content classified as higher severity, or recurring conduct indicating intentionality (such as recurring jailbreak attempts) are both more likely to receive a high score indicating potential abuse.

Our recommended essential development steps are grounded in the Microsoft Responsible AI Standard , which sets policy requirements that our own engineering teams follow. Much of the content of the Standard follows a pattern, asking teams to Discover, Protect, and Govern potential content risks. At Microsoft, our approach is guided by a governance framework rooted in AI principles, which establish product requirements and serve as our "north star." When we identify a business use case for generative AI, we first discover and assess the potential risks of the AI system to pinpoint critical focus areas. Once we identify these risks, we evaluate their prevalence within the AI system through systematic measurement, helping us prioritize areas that need attention. We then apply appropriate protection at the model and agent level against those risks. Finally, we examine strategies for managing risks in production, including deployment and operational readiness and setting up monitoring to support ongoing governance to ensure compliance and surface new risks after the application is live.

The goal of this article is to help get you started with this learning process. It attempts to capture general concepts and patterns that apply to all GPT models. However it's important to understand that each model behaves differently, so the learnings might not apply equally to all models. Basics This section covers the basic concepts and elements of GPT prompts. Text prompts are how users interact with GPT models. As with all generative language models, GPT models attempt to produce the next series of words that are most likely to follow from the previous text. It's as if we're saying What is the first thing that comes to your mind when I say <prompt> ? The examples below demonstrate this behavior. Given the first words of famous content, the model is able to accurately continue the text.

Performance and latency Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article This article provides you with background around how latency and throughput works with Azure OpenAI and how to optimize your environment to improve performance. Understanding throughput vs latency There are two key concepts to think about when sizing an application: (1) System level throughput measured in tokens per minute (TPM) and (2) Per-call response times (also known as latency). System level throughput This looks at the overall capacity of your deployment – how many requests per minute and total tokens that can be processed. For a standard deployment, the quota assigned to your deployment partially determines the amount of throughput you can achieve. However, quota only determines the admission logic for calls to the deployment and isn't directly enforcing throughput. Due to per-call latency variations, you might not be able to achieve throughput as high as your quota. In a provisioned deployment, a set amount of model processing capacity is allocated to your endpoint. The amount of throughput that you can achieve on the endpoint is a factor of the workload shape including input token amount, output amount, call rate and cache match rate. The number of concurrent calls and total tokens processed can vary based on these values. For all deployment types, understanding system level throughput is a key component of optimizing performance. It is important to consider system level throughput for a given model, version, and workload combination as the throughput will vary across these factors.

Planning red teaming for large language models (LLMs) and their applications Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article This guide offers some potential strategies for planning how to set up and manage red teaming for responsible AI (RAI) risks throughout the large language model (LLM) product life cycle. What is red teaming? The term red teaming has historically described systematic adversarial attacks for testing security vulnerabilities. With the rise of LLMs, the term has extended beyond traditional cybersecurity and evolved in common usage to describe many kinds of probing, testing, and attacking of AI systems. With LLMs, both benign and adversarial usage can produce potentially harmful outputs, which can take many forms, including harmful content such as hate speech, incitement or glorification of violence, or sexual content. Why is RAI red teaming an important practice? Red teaming is a best practice in the responsible development of systems and features using LLMs. While not a replacement for systematic measurement and mitigation work, red teamers help to uncover and identify harms and, in turn, enable measurement strategies to validate the effectiveness of mitigations. While Microsoft has conducted red teaming exercises and implemented safety systems (including content filters and other mitigation strategies ) for its Azure OpenAI in Microsoft Foundry Models (see this Overview of responsible AI practices ), the context of each LLM application will be unique and you also should conduct red teaming to: Test the LLM base model and determine whether there are gaps in the existing safety systems, given the contex

Standard Agent Setup uses customer-managed, single-tenant Azure resources to store agent state and keep all agent data under your control. In this setup: Agent states (conversations, responses) are stored in your own Azure resources. Leveraging your own resources for storing customer data Both standard setup configurations are designed to give you complete control over sensitive data by requiring the use of your own Azure resources. The required Bring Your Own (BYO) resources include: BYO File Storage : All files uploaded by developers (during agent configuration) or end-users (during interactions) are stored directly in the customer’s Azure Storage account. BYO Search : All vector stores created by the agent leverage the customer’s Azure AI Search resource. BYO Thread Storage : All customer messages and conversation history will be stored in the customer’s own Azure Cosmos DB account. By bundling these BYO features (file storage, search, and thread storage), the standard setup guarantees that your deployment is secure by default. All data processed by Foundry Agent Service is automatically stored at rest in your own Azure resources, helping you meet internal policies, compliance requirements, and enterprise security standards.

If you are using a hub-based project or Azure OpenAI Assistants At this time, there is no direct upgrade path to migrate existing agents or their associated data assets such as files, conversations, or vector stores from a hub-based project to a Microsoft Foundry project. There is also no upgrade path to convert existing Azure OpenAI Assistants into Foundry Agents, nor a way to automatically migrate Assistants' files, conversations, or vector stores. You can reuse your existing model deployments and quota from Foundry Tools or Azure OpenAI resources within a Foundry project. SDK usage with hub-based projects Starting in May 2025, the Azure AI Agent Service uses an endpoint for Foundry projects instead of the connection string that was used for hub-based projects before this time. Connection strings are no longer supported in current versions of the SDKs and REST API. We recommend creating a new foundry project.

For more information, see Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews . This article explains how to set up a managed virtual network for your Foundry resource. Managed virtual network streamlines and automates network isolation for your Foundry resource by provisioning a Microsoft‑managed virtual network that secures the Agents service underlying compute within your Foundry projects. When enabled, Agents outbound network traffic is secured by this managed network boundary, and the isolation mode you choose governs all the traffic. You can create the required private endpoints to dependent Azure services and apply the necessary network rules, giving you a secure default without requiring you to build or maintain your own virtual network. This managed network restricts what your Agents can access, helping prevent data exfiltration while still allowing connectivity to approved Azure resources. Before continuing, consider the limitations of the offering and review the prerequisites. This feature is currently in public preview, so consider preview conditions before enabling this network isolation method.

Rotate API keys Feedback Summarize this article for me In this article Each resource has two API keys to enable secret rotation. This is a security precaution that lets you regularly change the keys that can be used to access your service, protecting the privacy of your resource if a key gets leaked. How to rotate keys You can rotate keys using the following procedure: If you're using both keys in production, change your code so that only one key is in use. In this guide, assume it's key 1. This is a necessary step because once a key is regenerated, the older version of that key stops working immediately. This would cause clients using the older key to get 401 access denied errors. Once you have only key 1 in use, you can regenerate key 2. Go to your resource's page on the Azure portal, select the Keys and Endpoint tab, and select the Regenerate Key 2 button at the top of the page. Next, update your code to use the newly generated key 2. It helps to have logs or availability to check that users of the key have successfully swapped from using key 1 to key 2 before you proceed. Now you can regenerate key 1 using the same process. Finally, update your code to use the new key 1. See also Configure key-less authentication Feedback Was this page helpful?
